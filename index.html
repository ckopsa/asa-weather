<div id="how-accurate-are-us-weather-predictions" class="section level2">
<h2>How Accurate are US Weather Predictions?</h2>
<p>There it is, the question of this study. Knowing nearly nothing about weather predictions and their accuracy, when the ASA started a data <a href="http://community.amstat.org/stat-computing/data-expo/data-expo-2018">expo</a> on the topic, my choice became clear.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-tidying" class="section level2">
<h2>The Tidying</h2>
<p>The data from the expo came rather clean. It really just came down to joining the data together by city/state and finding the difference between the actual temperatures/precipitation for the day and the predictions. Each row was then able to be an observation. Filtering out non-numeric values and from the prediction values and selecting a time period where the data was proportional for all cities was the last tidying necessary before exploration of the data could begin.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-exploration" class="section level2">
<h2>The Exploration</h2>
<p>Best viewed in full-screen: <div id="htmlwidget-1efdfd7a9cb188332c33" style="width:900px;height:550px;" class="trelliscopejs_widget html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-1efdfd7a9cb188332c33">{"x":{"id":"2fe3e742","config_info":"'rmarkdown_files/appfiles/config.jsonp'","self_contained":false,"latest_display":{"name":"Weather","group":"common"},"spa":false,"in_knitr":true,"in_notebook":false},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script></p>
<p>With the data sufficiently tidy, trelliscope-js was able to portray the data in a way where trends/patterns could be more easily extractable from the data. Pretty quickly I was able to realize a common element and focus the scope of my question: difference in precipitation. Then my question became, which states are most innacurate in their precipitation predictions. It seemed that states near large bodies of water were most innaccurate in their predictions of precipitation. This seemed like a job for spatial graphics and so I left the trelliscope to examine the leaflet.</p>

<p>After viewing the data spatially, I was quickly able to determine that it wasn’t all states near large bodies of water that had poor precipitation predictions, rather it seemed to focus on Northern and Eastern states, including Hawaii. Why doesn’t California have innacturate precipitation predicitons? Hmm… looks like this may have to be a series…</p>
